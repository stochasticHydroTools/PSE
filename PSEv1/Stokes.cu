    \param deltaT           timestep
    \param d_net_force      net force on each particle, only used to set "accelerations"

    This kernel must be executed with a 1D grid of any block size such that the number of threads is greater than or
    equal to the number of members in the group. The kernel's implementation simply reads one particle in each thread
    and updates that particle. (Not necessary true for Stokesian Dynamics simulation)

    <b>Performance notes:</b>
    Particle properties are read via the texture cache to optimize the bandwidth obtained with sparse groups. The writes
    in sparse groups will not be coalesced. However, because ParticleGroup sorts the index list the writes will be as
    contiguous as possible leading to fewer memory transactions on compute 1.3 hardware and more cache hits on Fermi. (Not sure about this..)
